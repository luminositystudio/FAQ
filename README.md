#### Q: Why are gallery or random pictures showing up as album art?
Settings -> Images -> Ignore media store covers -> Enable

#### Q: Which file types are supported?
1Music Player uses the native media player that comes with your Android phone, so as long as a file type is supported by your phone, it's supported by 1Music Player.

#### Q: Why is my device slowing down when I'm using the app?
1Music Player is image intensive, it keeps images in the cache for quick loading.

#### Q: The title "1Music Player" is showing on the top of the app, how can i fix this?
Clear the app's cache and data.

### Q: My app is crashing, how do i fix this? (Sorry, settings have changed internally)
Reinstalling the app should fix this issue.

### Q: Why has all the text gone white/dissapeared?
Change the theme to Black or Dark and change it back to what you had before.

### Q: Why some of my songs are not showing in my library?
Try checking up if those songs are not less than 30 seconds, if so head to settings -> other -> filter song duration. Put this to zero and see the songs should start appearing in the library.  
If this doesn't work out for you, re-scanning the media folder should help and subsequently rebooting the device to refresh media store.  
At last resort, If nothing worked and your audio files are stored in SD card. Try moving them to internal memory then back to SD card.

Playlist/Playlist songs disappearing is based on android media store system. Save those playlist as file(Tap on three dot menu next to available playlist and save as file) and it should get fixed.

### Q: Why does my library shows song files twice or no song at all?
If you are seeing duplication of songs in the library or no songs at all, then it's because of Media Store issue which got affected by some other app.  
To fix this:  
• Head to your device settings  
• Open up "Apps & notifications" (This name depends from ROM to ROM)  
• Find 'Media storage' app and clear storage (both data and cache) of it.  
• Then open 1Music Player app and manually scan your music from your storage.  
• Reboot the device to refresh media store (Not sure if this is necessary)

NOTE: Don't panic when you will open 1Music Player and see "Zero" songs there in the library. It's because you cleared Media Store which is responsible for recognizing files on your device.
